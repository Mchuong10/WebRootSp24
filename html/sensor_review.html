<a href="https://developer.android.com/develop/sensors-and-location/sensors/sensors_overview">Android Sensor Overview</a><br />
Sensor documentation created and maintained by Google for Android developers.  Excellent information on what sensors are available and how to get to them.<br />

<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/android-sensors-with-example/">Android Sensors with learning examples</a><br />
This is a really nice laid out page with code examples and testing to try in order to learn about Android sensors. It shows both java and kotlin<br />

<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/web-apis/generic-sensor">Sensors for the Web</a><br />
Great source for how to use APIs to connect to the sensors and use them on the web, it has hands on training as well as ways to work around browsers that don't have access to 
the generic API. <br />

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sukeR4IZi1Q"> Getting Started Building Mobile Applications for iOS and Android</a><br />
This is a nice easy to understand video that goes over how to set up a app in IOS and Android. It is a little outdated so I only rated it 3 out of 5 but it has a lot of good information
about considerations and what to think about when building a app and the sensors that are available for each operatind system.<br />
